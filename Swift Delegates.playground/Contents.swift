// Swift Delegates

/*
 * Design Pattern - A general, reuseable solution to a commonly occuring problem
 * within a given context, regardless of the particular domain.
 *
 * Delegate (Decorator) Pattern - A variation of a design pattern, a structural
 * pattern that is focused on how we compose objects to form larger
 * structures.  Specifically this pattern is concerned with how we can add
 * additional responsibility to an object dynamically, that is at runtime rather
 * than statically at compile time.
